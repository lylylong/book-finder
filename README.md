# Book Finder

## Description

This Book Finder app is a very useful tool for people who want to search for new books to read. It's possible to create an account and can keep a list of books to purchase.

Let's see how this app works, it provides the following functionality:

- When you open this book finder in your web browser, the page will load: the options Search for Books & Login/Signup; and an input field to search for books and a submit button.

- If you are not a loged in user, and you search for books: you will be presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.

- If you have logged in or signed up an account, you will be logged in to the site. The menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see your saved books, and Logout.

- You enter a search term as a logged in user, you will be presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to your account.

- When you click on the Save button on a book then that book’s information is saved to your account. When you click on the option to see your saved books, you will be presented with all of the books you have saved, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from the account.

- When you click on the "Remove" button on a book, that book is deleted from your saved books list. When you click on the "Logout" button, you will be logged out of the site, and the menu will display less options.
